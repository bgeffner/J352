<p>Colleges within Maryland – including Towson University, University of Maryland and Morgan State University – are in the midst of a housing crisis. A myriad of public four-year institutions within the state are failing to provide students with appropriate on-campus housing due to lack of resources, poor preparation and over-enrollment, among a plethora of other factors.</p>

<p>About 80 single University of Maryland dorm rooms were transformed into doubles to accommodate an additional 500 students in the fall of 2023. Also, a record-breaking rate of incoming freshman classes seen the last two years at nearby Towson University has forced the school to begin adding two to three people to a room and even converting floor lounges into group rooms, according to recent findings<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2023/08/30/squeezing-more-beds-into-dorm-rooms-converting-lounges-maryland-universities-adapt-to-meet-housing-demand/" target="_blank"> in the Baltimore Sun.</p></a>

<p>Furthermore, older dorms in a majority of Maryland’s public universities that are still intact to house students can generally be seen as out of date or unsuitable for long-term use — often due to an absence of air conditioning units and old furniture, as well as mold, disheveled bathrooms and lounge spaces.</p>

<p>According to the<a href="https://reslife.umd.edu/terp-housing/residence-halls" target="_blank"> University of Maryland’s Department of Resident Life</a>, the school has seven halls where individual rooms are not equipped with air conditioning: Caroline, Carroll, Cecil, Ellicott, Hagerstown, Wicomico and Worcester.</p>

<p>Prior to last year, Chestertown Hall was also included in that group — it is currently closed to install air conditioning and is scheduled to reopen this fall, <a href="https://dbknews.com/2024/04/17/stamp-panera-air-conditioning-rha-town-hall/" target="_blank">per The Diamondback.</p></a>

<p>Statistically, the seven residence halls without air conditioning translates to over 1,500 students living on the College Park without air conditioning (1,556 in specific). The lack of updated dorm facilities and temperature changes in non-AC halls has had tangible effects on underclassmen students.</p>

<p>“Being in one of the couple of dorms without air conditioning was really difficult during last year’s hot weather,” a current University of Maryland sophomore student said. “It was probably 90 degrees in my dorm, so trying to sleep was really difficult and not comfortable or super safe.</p>

<p>“Considering we have to pay the same amount of money as students in much nicer dorms, it’s just not fair. I don’t understand how a college like UMD can say that they accepted too many people so that means they’re not able to have some students live on-campus, or they’re putting others really far off-campus. There’s really not enough current student housing and infrastructure here,” the student continued.</p>

<p>One clearly identifiable cause of this newfound university housing crisis can be attributed to a general over enrollment of students. The more first-year students that enroll to these colleges on a year-by-year basis effectively increases the potential likelihood that on-campus housing will be limited or students may be forced to cram into impacted spaces.</p>

<p>In 2022, Neya Glover learned just a week before move-in that she was one of 465 students at Morgan State University to be placed at a hotel instead of a dormitory. As a result, she was forced to take a 20 minute shuttle everyday to and from campus — the impact of the university being overenrolled with students and unable to provide on-campus housing to all incoming students. Even after financial aid, she still was forced to pay nearly $6,000 for one semester at The Lord Baltimore Hotel, <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2023/08/30/squeezing-more-beds-into-dorm-rooms-converting-lounges-maryland-universities-adapt-to-meet-housing-demand/" target="_blank">Glover said.</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://dbknews.com/2023/08/01/incoming-freshmen-on-campus-housing-capacity/" target="_blank">The Diamondback</a> describes how the University of Maryland’s Resident Life Department delivered a widespread message two summers ago describing a notable increase in total on-campus housing requests, and how despite certain students securing individualized housing, the higher than expected confirmation rate — and the housing uncertainty it caused — was “stressful” to students.</p>

<p>While dorm conditions and the over-enrollment of students serve as primary causes for an in-state housing crisis within Maryland’s four-year public colleges — the effects can also be seen on an increased widespread, nationwide landscape at other universities across the country.</p>

<p>20 percent of college students across the country struggle to find stable housing, while one in five students have faced housing insecurity and find themselves without a permanent place of residence while studying as a result, per <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/20percent-of-college-students-struggle-to-find-stable-housing.html" target="_blank">NBC News</a> and <a href="https://www.studentbeans.com/blog/us/student-beans-housing-insecurity-report/" target="_blank">Student Beans</a>, respectively. 36 percent of students admitted to thinking about dropping out of college due to their financial situation — a number that rises to 62 percent for those who have dealt with housing insecurity.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1204801576" target="_blank">Maya Fawaz of NPR</a> explicitly detailed this housing issue in comparison to recent yearly events at Texas State University.</p>

<p>“The school has had to turn lots of single-occupancy rooms into doubles and doubles into triples. Even some study rooms were turned into bedrooms,” Fawaz said. “Texas State admitted a record number of freshmen for its third consecutive year. And once again, it's struggling with where to put its record-sized freshman class.”</p>

<p>Potential solutions to accurately address this issue — without being forced to compact students into limited living spaces — could include expanding to build new dorms, capping enrollment numbers and forming a commuter/online only quota to limit student housing need on campuses, as well as improving and updating older residence halls.</p>

<p>In an effort to address a student spike of over 2,000 in just two years, Morgan State built a new dorm, Legacy Hall, and renovated two of its other dorms in Baldwin Hall and Cummings House, according to university officials.</p>

<p>“This is part of a very strategic vision for the university to accommodate as many students as we can with housing options," Dell Jackson, Morgan State University’s Director of Public Relations, <a href="https://www.wmar2news.com/local/morgan-state-university-adds-new-housing-to-keep-up-with-rising-enrollment" target="_blank">told WMAR-2 News Baltimore.</a></p>

<p>Still, despite recent efforts made by local universities, students and colleges alike within Maryland – Towson University, University of Maryland and Morgan State University in specific  –  are reeling from the detrimental effects of a widespread housing crisis. Backed by statistical evidence and growing population trends, this plight is gradually contributing to an overall worsening student collegiate experience.</p>

<p>“Living like this is just really unsustainable,” Jona Jancewicz, a University of Maryland student currently living in on-campus housing without air conditioning, said in a firsthand interview. “I really think changes need to be made so future incoming students can just have an improved residential experience.”</p>
