<h1>Welcome to My Luka Doncic Page!</h1>


<p>Welcome to the digital shrine for Luka Doncic, our future.</p>

<p>Here you will find all of Luka's greatest work, including a playoff buzzer-beating silencer over Rudy Gobert!</p>

<p>If you don't believe me, look at his <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/doncilu01.html" target="_blank">Basketball Reference Stats</a> page. Don't know why the Mavericks would trade him, but Lakers nation will happily take him.</p>

<p>Check out video highlights <a href="video.html">here</a></p>
