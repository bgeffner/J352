<h3>I believe that there is both a noticeable connection and correlation between rest days and team performances within the NBA, and that these two factors often go hand in hand in helping to paint the overall outcomes of specific games. Overall, based on personal beliefs and backed by proven analytics, all 30 teams both over time and today within the modern NBA play better and typically win more with increased rest time before games — as opposed to disadvantaged rest time seen in back-to-back games or even in games with just one day's rest preceding it. Though better teams (such as the Celtics, Thunder and Cavaliers, among others listed above) tend to have higher win percentages over a given season, these statistics represent and show elevated win rates with rest advantages for a majority of teams — including generally subpar non-playoff teams like the Suns, Kings, Spurs and Bulls, all of which were over .500 in games with varying amounts of rest advantages over respective opponents. These statistics effectively confirm the trend — a widespread correlation and impact is seen across nearly the entirety of the NBA between rest days and elevated team performance in a given season, further emphasized with factors such as large sample sizes and an array of margin of victory rates that help understand and match this data through a statistical perspective.</h3>

<h3>The main focus of the first three datasets shown is to isolate numbers based strictly from the 2024-25 season, providing a current grouping of findings relative to my examination. I believe these initial three findings support my hypothesis that NBA teams play better and win more with increased rest time before games. 21 of 30 NBA teams boast over .500 winning record rates with a rest advantage, and more than half of all teams are above .500 following two days off prior to specific games. Furthermore, 21 unique teams also hold at or below .500 win percentage rates following a rest disadvantage — games in which a team's respective opponent enters with more rest and time off than them. The "Rest Split" dataset in specific allows viewers to compare specific team results, fluctuated and weighted for change by other aforementioned factors such as a team's overall win rate and strength, while isolating different rest split classes. Furthermore, while the first three datasets represent rest statistics isolated from just the 2024-25 NBA season, the fourth dataset marks a year over year trend across a widespread historical span, confirming a high rate of successful teams relative to rest advantage trends over time. Despite a recent dip within the past four years, all four unique time periods since 2003 illustrate how at least 66 percent of all NBA teams have continually boasted positive win percentage rates. This, in turn, provides a overarching sense of consistency in concluding that, historically speaking, there is a noticeable correlation and boost between NBA teams entering a game with a rest advantage and overall win percentages across the given stretch.</h3>
